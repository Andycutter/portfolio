### 1. Introduction
This webpage is a work in progress.
The scope of the page is to show the reader the projects I have been working on during my time at Craft Academy. Further more there are a bit of different content as links to various cheat sheets, some 'slacker tricks' (meant as a joke..) and a page about random stuff...that links to [random.org](https://random.org)
There is a section 'About' that contains information about me and my CV.
The 'Contact' show how to get in touch.

### 2. Building the site
The site has been made using HAML, CSS with SASS and Middleman to generate the final static site and to manage partials.
